Part backorders is a common supply chain problem. Working to identify parts at risk of backorder before the event occurs so the business has time to react. Data file contains the historical data for the 8 weeks prior to the week we are trying to predict. The data was taken as weekly snapshots at the start of each week.

went_on_backorder - Product actually went on backorder or not. This is the target variable.

 2 datasets , product_train.csv and product_test.csv is given . You need to use data product_train to build predictive model for response variable ‘went_on_backorder’. product_test data contains all other factors except ‘went_on_backorder’, you need to predict the response as hard classes (Yes or No)  using the model that you developed.

Evaluation Criterion : KS score on test data.
